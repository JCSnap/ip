## Quick Start
### Setting up
Before you can start using BouncyBob, you will need to have Java 11 installed on your computer. Here are the different guides to installing Java 11 on different operating systems:
- [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA)
- [MacOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-2FE451B0-9572-4E38-A1A5-568B77B146DE)
